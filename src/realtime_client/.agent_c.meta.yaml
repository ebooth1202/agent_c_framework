          - Use appropriate background colors (info blue, warning yellow, etc.)

          - Include system icon or appropriate indicator

          Required Conversions:

          1. User messages → user_message events

          2. Assistant text blocks → text_delta events

          3. Assistant thinking blocks → thought_delta events

          4. Tool use blocks → tool_call events (with active=false for resumed)

          5. Tool result blocks → tool_result events


          Implementation:

          - New method: convertMessagesToEvents(messages: MessageParam[])

          - Emit converted events through standard event pipeline

          - Ensure identical rendering to streamed content


          Test with: //realtime_client/.scratch/chat_fixes/session_with_delegation.json
