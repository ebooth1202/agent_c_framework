            "1. Breaking down complex problems into steps\n"
            "2. Planning and design with room for revision\n"
            "3. Analysis that might need course correction\n"
            "4. Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially\n"
            "5. Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps\n"
            "6. Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out\n\n"
            
            "## Recommended Approach\n"
            "1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts\n"
            "2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts\n"
            "3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the 'end'\n"
            "4. Express uncertainty when present\n"
            "5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths\n"
            "6. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done\n"
