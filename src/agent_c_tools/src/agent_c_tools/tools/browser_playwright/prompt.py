            "- **Navigation**: Visit URLs, go back/forward, and refresh pages\n"
            "- **Page Interaction**: Click elements, type text, select options from dropdowns\n"
            "- **Form Filling**: Input text, check/uncheck boxes, submit forms\n"
            "- **Tab Management**: Create, close, and switch between tabs\n"
            "- **Information Extraction**: Get page snapshots with accessibility information\n"

            "## Best Practices\n"
            "1. Always check the page snapshot before interacting with elements\n"
            "2. Use appropriate waiting mechanisms when page content might be changing\n"
            "3. Handle navigation and page transitions properly\n"
            "4. Close browser sessions when done to free up resources\n"
            "5. Use appropriate error handling for more resilient automation\n\n"
            
            "## Example Workflow\n"
            "1. Navigate to a webpage\n"
            "2. Get a page snapshot to understand the page structure\n"
            "3. Locate elements of interest from the snapshot\n"
            "4. Interact with those elements (click, type, etc.)\n"
            "5. Capture results or screenshots as needed\n"
