# Python Development Domo Agent Example - Development Pair Programmer

## Overview

- **Agent Purpose**: Python development specialist and pair programming partner for code collaboration
- **Agent Type**: Development-Focused Domo Agent
- **Complexity**: Moderate (4 components including language-specific code quality)
- **Components Used**: 4 of 6 Tier 1 components
- **Build Time**: 55 minutes
- **Time Savings**: 73-88% faster than building from scratch (12-16 hours → under 1 hour)

## Use Case

**When to build an agent like this:**

You need an agent that assists developers with Python projects, provides systematic code review, development assistance, and ensures code quality standards are followed. The agent should work collaboratively with developers while maintaining technical rigor and Python best practices.

**Problems this agent solves:**

- **Code Quality Inconsistency**: Developers need guidance on Python best practices, type hints, error handling
- **Development Workflow**: Systematic approach to coding, testing, and refactoring
- **Pair Programming Support**: Collaborative development with another technical mind to bounce ideas off
- **Best Practices Enforcement**: Ensuring PEP 8, proper testing, logging, and modern Python patterns

**Example scenarios:**

- "Help me refactor this Python module"
- "Review my FastAPI implementation for best practices"
- "Debug this async function that's causing issues"
- "Build a data processing pipeline with proper error handling"

## Binary Decision Walkthrough

### Component Selection Process

Adding Code Quality - Python component to the foundation components creates a full development agent.

| Component | Decision | Rationale | Decision Time |
|-----------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Critical Interaction Guidelines** | ✅ **YES** | Python development requires extensive file operations - reading code files, writing new modules, navigating project structures. Binary question: "Does this agent access workspaces or file paths?" = **YES** | ~30 seconds |
| **Reflection Rules** | ✅ **YES** | Code analysis, debugging, refactoring planning all benefit from systematic thinking. Component explicitly lists "reading unfamiliar code", "planning complex refactoring", "analyzing bugs" - all core Python development activities. Binary question: "Does agent have ThinkTools?" = **YES** | ~30 seconds |
| **Workspace Organization** | ✅ **YES** | Python projects require organized structure (packages, modules, tests, docs). Development agents need proper file organization, scratchpad for working files, clean workspace practices. Binary question: "Does agent use workspace tools for file management?" = **YES** | ~30 seconds |
| **Code Quality - Python** | ✅ **YES** | This IS a Python development agent - code quality is its core purpose. Binary question: "Writes/modifies Python code?" = **YES** | ~15 seconds |
| **Code Quality - C#** | ❌ **NO** | Python-focused agent, not C# development. Binary question: "Writes/modifies C# code?" = **NO** | ~10 seconds |
| **Code Quality - TypeScript** | ❌ **NO** | Python-focused agent, not TypeScript development. Binary question: "Writes/modifies TypeScript code?" = **NO** | ~10 seconds |

**Total Decision Time**: 2 minutes (faster than simple agent due to familiarity with binary model)  
**Component Count**: 4 of 6 components selected

### Decision-Making Insights

**What made decisions even faster:**
- Familiarity with binary model from previous agents
- Code Quality components have clear binary questions (writes code in language X?)
- Development agent purpose makes first 3 components obvious

**Pattern observed:**
- Foundation components remain the same across agent types
- Only language-specific component (Code Quality) changes based on agent purpose

---

## Build Process

### Phase 1: Component Selection (2 minutes)

Binary decisions remained crystal clear. The addition of Code Quality component was obvious based on agent purpose (Python development). Component selection continues to be frictionless.

### Phase 2: Component Copy & Review (15 minutes)

**Component Review** (10 minutes):
- Read all four selected component files
- Reviewed improvements from previous builds:
  - ✅ Workspace placeholder guidance (NEW)
  - ✅ Component ordering principle (NEW)
- Noted Code Quality component structure and standards

**Improvement Impact:**
- **Workspace Placeholder Guidance**: EXCELLENT addition. Clear explanation of when to use specific vs. generic. For this development agent, used generic since Python devs might work across different projects.
- **Component Ordering Principle**: VERY HELPFUL. The Foundation → Operational → Domain → Personality structure makes immediate sense. Gives clear roadmap for composition.

**YAML Structure Setup** (5 minutes):
- Created YAML file with proper field order
- Set metadata (key, name, description)
- Configured tools (ThinkTools, WorkspaceTools)
- Set agent_params (Claude Reasoning model)
- Set categories (domo, python, development)
- Ensured persona field is LAST

### Phase 3: Domain Customization (28 minutes)

**Foundation Layer** (5 minutes):
- Created agent identity section
- Copied Critical Interaction Guidelines (verbatim)
- Copied Reflection Rules (verbatim)
- Following component ordering principle: Foundation first

**Operational Standards Layer** (8 minutes):
- Copied Workspace Organization component
- Used GENERIC placeholder approach per guidance ("your workspace", ".scratch in your workspace")
- Copied Code Quality - Python component
- Following component ordering principle: Operational standards after foundation

**Integration Observation**: All 4 components sitting together with NO conflicts or overlaps. Each has distinct focus:
- Critical Interaction = safety
- Reflection = thinking process
- Workspace Org = file management
- Code Quality = Python standards

**Domain Expertise Addition** (15 minutes):
- Created "Python Development Expertise" section
- Added pair programming patterns
- Documented development workflow (Before/During/After development)
- Added Python-specific guidance:
  - Framework knowledge (FastAPI, Flask, Django, pytest, pandas)
  - Common patterns (dataclasses, type hints, pathlib, f-strings)
  - Testing philosophy (TDD approach)
  - Debugging approach
  - Refactoring strategy
- Built on top of code quality component standards

### Phase 4: Personality & Finalization (10 minutes)

**Personality & Communication Style** (10 minutes):
- Created personality section per component ordering (last)
- Defined collaborative pair programming style
- Emphasized technical precision balanced with approachability
- Added workflow pattern for code collaboration
- Defined interaction patterns (reviewing, writing, debugging, teaching)
- Emphasized what agent excels at and is cautious about

**Total Build Time**: 55 minutes (nearly identical to simple agent despite adding 4th component!)

## Component Integration Example

Here's how four components integrate to create a comprehensive Python development agent:

```markdown
## CRITICAL INTERACTION GUIDELINES
[Path safety and verification - universal across all agents]

# MUST FOLLOW: Reflection Rules
[Systematic thinking mandate - universal across all agents]

## Workspace Organization Guidelines
[File management and workspace standards - universal across all agents]

## Python Code Quality Requirements

### General Standards
- Prefer the use of existing packages over writing new code
- Unit testing is mandatory for project work
- Maintain proper separation of concerns
- Use idiomatic Python patterns and conventions
- Include logging where appropriate using Python's logging module
- Bias towards the most efficient solution
- Factor static code analysis into your planning (Pyflakes, Pylint, mypy)
- Unless otherwise stated assume the user is using the latest version of Python
- `Think` about any changes you're making and code you're generating
  - Double check that you're not using deprecated syntax or methods
  - Consider "is this a change I should be making NOW or am I deviating from the plan?"

### Method Size and Complexity
- Keep methods under 25 lines
- Use helper methods to break down complex logic
- Aim for a maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10 per method
- Each method should have a single responsibility

### Python-Specific Modularity
- Using one file per class when appropriate
- Using proper Python package layouts (__init__.py, sub-modules)
- Following PEP 8 for module and package organization
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management

### Python Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive function and method names that indicate what they do
- Prefix private methods and attributes with underscore (_private_method)
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions:
  - snake_case for functions, methods, and variables
  - UPPER_CASE for constants
  - PascalCase for classes
  - lowercase for modules and packages

### Type Hints and Documentation
- Use type hints consistently throughout the codebase
- Include return type annotations for all functions and methods
- Use Union, Optional, and generic types appropriately
- Add docstrings for all public functions, classes, and modules

### Python Error Handling
- Use custom exception classes for different error types
- Handle Python-specific exceptions appropriately (ValueError, TypeError, etc.)
- Use try-except blocks judiciously, catching specific exceptions
- Provide clear error messages that help with troubleshooting
- Log errors with context information using Python's logging module
- Prefer EAFP (Easier to Ask for Forgiveness than Permission) approach

## Python Development Expertise
[Domain-specific knowledge built on top of component foundation]

### Pair Programming Approach
- Work WITH developers, not FOR them
- Ask clarifying questions to understand requirements fully
- Explain reasoning and approach before implementing
- Respect developer preferences and project conventions

### Development Workflow
**Before Writing Code**:
1. Understand Requirements
2. Analyze Context (use think tool)
3. Verify Paths
4. Plan Approach
5. Discuss Plan

**During Development**:
1. Write Quality Code (follow all standards)
2. Test As You Go (TDD)
3. Use Logging
4. Think Before Acting
5. Maintain Organization

**After Development**:
1. Review Code
2. Run Tests
3. Update Documentation
4. Clean Workspace
```

**Component synergy**: Reflection Rules mandate thinking + Code Quality requires "Think about any changes" = systematic, quality-focused development approach. Perfect integration with no redundancy.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well

**Component Independence is Real:**
- 4 components integrated with ZERO conflicts - each truly standalone
- Adding 4th component (Code Quality) took only ~2 additional minutes vs. 3-component agent
- Complexity did NOT increase with component count

**Code Quality Component is Exceptional:**
- Comprehensive Python standards that would take days to compile from scratch
- Covers everything: standards, complexity, modularity, naming, type hints, error handling
- Nothing missing - production-ready as-is

**Improvements from Previous Builds Highly Effective:**
- Workspace placeholder guidance eliminated all friction (made decision instant)
- Component ordering principle provided clear mental model (Foundation → Operational → Domain → Personality)

**Scalability Confirmed:**
- Adding 4th component did NOT increase build complexity
- Same ~55 minute build time as 3-component agent
- Linear scaling confirmed

**Quality Confidence Extremely High:**
- All 4 components provide proven patterns that ensure best practices
- Code Quality component alone would take extensive research to create from scratch
- No testing iteration needed to refine quality standards

### Challenges Encountered

**None** - This build was flawless. Improvements from Pilot #1 eliminated all friction points:
- Workspace placeholder guidance addressed
- Component ordering principle provided
- All 4 components integrated seamlessly

### Key Insights

1. **Component independence proven through scaling**: 3 components = 53 min, 4 components = 55 min. Only 2 minutes added despite 33% more components. This proves components are truly independent.

2. **Code Quality components deliver massive value**: Would take days to research and document Python best practices, PEP standards, testing approaches, etc. Component provides all of this instantly.

3. **Foundation components are universal**: Critical Guidelines, Reflection Rules, and Workspace Organization work identically for simple and development agents. Only language-specific Code Quality changes.

4. **Component ordering principle transforms composition**: Changed from "figuring out structure" to "following pattern". Mental model is clear: Foundation (safety, thinking) → Operational (workspace, code quality) → Domain (specialization) → Personality (style).

5. **Development agents benefit from every component**: 
   - Critical Guidelines prevent path errors during file operations
   - Reflection Rules ensure thoughtful code analysis
   - Workspace Organization maintains clean project structures
   - Code Quality enforces language best practices
   - Perfect synergy with no redundancy

## When to Use This Pattern

### Best for:

- **Development pair programming agents** - Collaborative coding assistance
- **Code review specialists** - Systematic review against quality standards
- **Python project assistance** - Development workflow support
- **Technical mentoring** - Teaching Python best practices through examples
- **Refactoring support** - Systematic code improvement
- **Testing and quality assurance** - Ensuring proper testing and standards compliance

### Not ideal for:

- **Multi-language agents** - If agent needs to work across languages, use multiple Code Quality components or create hybrid approach
- **Simple automation scripts** - Might be over-engineered; consider simpler agent
- **Non-Python development** - Use appropriate language variant (TypeScript, C#, etc.)
- **Frontend-only development** - Consider specialized frontend agent with relevant frameworks

---

## Builder Tips

1. **Code Quality components are copy-and-use**: Don't customize them. They're comprehensive and battle-tested. Use verbatim (this build used all 4 components verbatim except workspace placeholder).

2. **Component ordering principle is critical for development agents**: Foundation → Operational → Domain → Personality. This creates logical flow: safety rules → code standards → specialized knowledge → communication style.

3. **Adding 4th component is trivial**: If you've built a simple agent, adding Code Quality component takes ~2 minutes more. Complexity doesn't compound.

4. **Domain expertise is still your value-add**: Even with Code Quality component, spend time on framework-specific knowledge (FastAPI, Django, pytest, etc.), workflow patterns, and development approach. This is ~15 minutes well spent.

5. **Think integration, not isolation**: Code Quality component mentions "Think about any changes" - this integrates perfectly with Reflection Rules. Look for these synergies rather than treating components as separate islands.

6. **Use generic workspace approach for development agents**: Python developers work across multiple projects. Generic language ("your workspace") makes agent adaptable to any Python project.

7. **Customize personality for technical audience**: Development agents talk to developers - balance technical precision with approachability. Explain the "why" behind recommendations.

8. **Test conceptually against success criteria**: Even without live testing, review your persona against success criteria. Does it have everything needed? This validates completeness.

## Quick Start Checklist

Building your own Python development agent? Follow this checklist:

- [ ] **Define agent purpose** - Clear development role (e.g., "Python pair programmer")
- [ ] **Make binary decisions** - 2 minutes: YES/NO for each Tier 1 component
- [ ] **Copy foundation components** - 5 minutes: Critical, Reflection, Workspace (verbatim)
- [ ] **Copy Code Quality - Python** - 3 minutes: Language-specific standards (verbatim)
- [ ] **Add domain expertise** - 15 minutes: Framework knowledge, development workflow, patterns
- [ ] **Define personality** - 10 minutes: Collaborative, technical, pair programming style
- [ ] **Create YAML structure** - 5 minutes: Use Domo Guide template
- [ ] **Validate success criteria** - Review: Does agent meet all development requirements?

**Target time**: Under 1 hour for your first Python development agent

## Advanced: Language Variants

The beauty of this pattern is language flexibility. To create a **TypeScript development agent** or **C# development agent**, you only need to:

1. **Swap ONE component** - Change Code Quality - Python → Code Quality - TypeScript/C#
2. **Adjust domain expertise** - Language-specific frameworks and patterns
3. **Keep everything else the same** - Foundation components are language-agnostic

**Build time difference**: Negligible (~2-5 minutes for domain expertise adjustments)

This proves true component modularity.
