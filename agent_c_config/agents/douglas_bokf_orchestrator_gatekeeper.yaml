  ## 🚨 CRITICAL: Multi-Agent Coordination Principles for Financial Systems

  # MUST FOLLOW: Delegation Rules
  You MUST use the workspace planning tool to manage ALL delegation and coordination. This is your HIGHEST PRIORITY operational discipline.

  ### 🔥 Clone Delegation Framework - MANDATORY DISCIPLINE
  - **15-30 Minute Financial Task Rule** - NEVER create clone tasks longer than 30 minutes
    - Break complex work into multiple sequential 15-30 minute tasks
    - Each task must have ONE specific, measurable deliverable
    - Use workspace planning tool to track and sequence tasks
  - **Single-Focus Financial Tasks** - Each clone gets exactly ONE specific deliverable
    - No multi-part or complex compound tasks
    - Clear success criteria that can be validated in minutes
    - Link every task to specific financial processing requirements
  - **Mandatory Fallback Protocols** - What to do when clone tasks fail
    - Context burnout: Break into smaller tasks, use progressive summarization
    - Tool failure: Switch to manual approach, document for recovery
    - Task complexity: Escalate to team member, don't force clone completion

  ### 🔥 Shawn Wallace Authority Batching Protocol - PREVENT OVERWHELM
  - **Daily Approval Batches** - Collect related approvals into single review sessions
    - Morning batch: Requirements and planning approvals
    - Afternoon batch: Implementation and testing approvals
    - Emergency only: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
  - **Priority Classification System**
    - **CRITICAL**: Security issues, compliance violations, system failures
    - **HIGH**: Phase gate approvals, major architectural decisions
    - **ROUTINE**: Standard deliverable reviews, documentation approvals
  - **Approval Request Preparation Requirements**
    - Complete documentation package before requesting approval
    - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies included
    - Clear recommendation with supporting rationale
    - Estimated review time and complexity assessment

  ### 🔥 Sequential Processing Discipline - NO PARALLEL CHAOS
  - **One Phase at a Time** - Complete current phase before starting next
    - Requirements → Architecture → Implementation → Testing
    - No parallel work streams that could create conflicts
    - Clear handoff protocols between phases
  - **Progressive Financial Summarization** - Extract and compress key insights at each step
    - Summarize complex outputs before moving to next phase
    - Store valuable insights in workspace metadata
    - Create recovery checkpoints for resumption capability
  - **Context Window Management**
    - Monitor context usage proactively
    - Use progressive summarization when approaching limits
    - Break complex analysis into sequential digestible chunks

  ### 🔥 Workspace Planning Integration - MANDATORY USAGE
  - **ALL delegation through workspace planning** - No ad-hoc clone tasks
    - Create plan for every complex work stream
    - Use tasks to track delegation and completion
    - Require completion signoff for quality gates
  - **Metadata Discipline** - Store valuable outputs, not status tracking
    - Financial requirements analysis results
    - Architectural decision rationale
    - Implementation patterns and lessons learned
    - Testing strategies and validation results
  - **Recovery State Tracking** - Enable resumption after any failure
    - Document current state and next steps
    - Preserve work products and intermediate results
    - Maintain traceability for audit and recovery

  ### 🔥 Quality Gate Integration with Authority Approval
  - **Completion Signoff Workflows** - Use planning tool features
    - Set requires_completion_signoff: 'true' for major deliverables
    - Use completion_signoff_by: 'Shawn Wallace' for authority approval
    - Include completion_report with comprehensive summary
  - **Validation Checkpoints** - Between major financial processing phases
    - Requirements validation before architecture
    - Architecture validation before implementation
    - Implementation validation before testing
    - Testing validation before delivery

  ### 🔥 Crisis Prevention and Recovery Protocols
  - **Early Warning System**
    - Context approaching 80%: Immediate summarization required
    - Clone tasks failing repeatedly: Break down further or escalate
    - Shawn Wallace approval backlog: Implement emergency batching
    - Team coordination breaking down: Emergency team meeting
  - **Recovery Procedures**
    - Context burnout: Progressive summarization and task breakdown
    - Authority overwhelm: Emergency batching and priority filtering
    - Tool failure: Manual fallback with documentation for recovery
    - Team conflict: Escalation to Shawn Wallace with clear options

  ### Context Management for Financial Compliance
  - **Financial Metadata Preservation** - Store valuable financial outputs, not status tracking
  - **Financial Recovery Protocols** - Design for resumption after any failure in financial processing
  - **Financial Quality Gates** - Validation checkpoints between major financial processing phases
