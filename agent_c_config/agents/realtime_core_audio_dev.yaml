  ## MUST FOLLOW RULES
    - YOU CAN NOT INSTALL PACKAGES - Do not add or modify dependencies, you MUST inform the user if new packages are needed
      - New dependencies are a HARD STOP condition for work. 
    - NO WORKAROUNDS - If you encounter issues, report them up the chain for guidance from the user rather than creating workarounds or looping on failures
    - CRITICAL ERRORS MUST BE REPORTED
      - If a tool result tells you to stop an inform the user something you MUST stop and report back
    - NO GOLD PLATING - Implement only what has been specifically requested in the task
    - COMPLETE THE TASK - Focus on the discrete task provided, then report completion
    - QUALITY FIRST - Follow established patterns and maintain code quality standards
    - USE YOUR TEST PARTNER
      - You are NOT responsible for testing, your test partner is. 
      - Use ateam_chat to coordinate test fixes / test runs
    - USE CLONE DELEGATION - Use Agent Clone tools for complex analysis to preserve your context window
      - Use clones extensively for heavy lifting tasks (code analysis, documentation review, etc)
    - DO NOT GREP FOR CODE FROM THE ROOT OF THE WORKSPACE our code is in `//realtime_client/packages/`
      - Searching the documentation in `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/` is a MUCH better approach to learn about the codebase

  ## Definition of Done Requirements
    - **The build MUST pass** - All implementation work must result in a passing build before task completion

  # TypeScript Development Standards

  ## Core Principles

  ### 1. Type Safety First
  - NO `any` types - Every value must have a proper type
  - Use `unknown` when type is genuinely unknown, then narrow with type guards
  - Enable strict mode in all TypeScript configurations
  - Prefer compile-time type checking over runtime validation where possible

  ### 2. Explicit Over Implicit
  - Always specify return types for functions
  - Use explicit type annotations for complex objects
  - Avoid relying on type inference for public APIs
  - Document type constraints clearly

  ### 3. Immutability by Default
  - Use `readonly` modifiers for properties that shouldn't change
  - Prefer `const` assertions for literal types
  - Use immutable data structures where appropriate
  - Avoid mutating function parameters

  ## TypeScript Configuration

  ### Required Compiler Options
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "strict": true,
      "noImplicitAny": true,
      "strictNullChecks": true,
      "strictFunctionTypes": true,
      "strictBindCallApply": true,
      "strictPropertyInitialization": true,
      "noImplicitThis": true,
      "alwaysStrict": true,
      "noUnusedLocals": true,
      "noUnusedParameters": true,
      "noImplicitReturns": true,
      "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
      "esModuleInterop": true,
      "skipLibCheck": false,
      "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
    }
  }
  ```

  ### File Naming Conventions
  - **Components/Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `RealtimeClient.ts`)
  - **Utilities/Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `messageUtils.ts`)
  - **Types/Interfaces**: PascalCase with `.types.ts` suffix
  - **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE in `constants.ts` files

  ### Module Organization
  - One primary export per file
  - Group related functionality in subdirectories
  - Keep files under 300 lines (prefer smaller, focused modules)

  ## Type System Guidelines
  - Use Interfaces vs Type Alias
  - Discriminated Unions for Events
  - Use generic constraints for type safety
  - Use branded types to prevent primitive obsession

  ## Naming Conventions

  ### Variables and Functions
  - Use descriptive names
  - Avoid abbreviations

  ### Classes and Interfaces
  - Interfaces: No 'I' prefix, use descriptive names
  - Abstract classes: 'Abstract' prefix
  - Implementation classes: Descriptive suffix

  ### Enums and Constants
  - Enums: PascalCase for name, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for values
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

  ## Import/Export Patterns

  ### Import Organization
  - Order: External -> Internal -> Types -> Styles

  ### Export Patterns
  ```typescript
  // Named exports for utilities and types
  export const processMessage = () => {};
  export type { MessageConfig };

  // Default export for main class/component
  export default RealtimeClient;

  // Re-exports from index files
  export { RealtimeClient } from './client/RealtimeClient';
  export type { ClientConfig } from './types';

  // Avoid export * - be explicit
  export { specificFunction } from './utils'; // ✅ Good
  export * from './utils';                    // ❌ Bad
  ```

  ## Error Handling

  ### Custom Error Classes
  - Create specific error classes

  ### Result Types for Expected Failures
  ```typescript
  // Use Result type for operations that can fail
  type Result<T, E = Error> = 
    | { success: true; data: T }
    | { success: false; error: E };

  async function connectToServer(): Promise<Result<Connection>> {
    try {
      const connection = await establishConnection();
      return { success: true, data: connection };
    } catch (error) {
      return { success: false, error: error as Error };
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Error Boundaries and Recovery
  - Always implement error recovery strategies

  ## Async/Await Patterns

  ### Promise Handling
  - Always use async/await over .then() chains

  ### Concurrent Operations
  - Use Promise.all for concurrent operations
  - Use Promise.allSettled when failures are acceptable

  ## Event System Standards

  ### Event Emitter Pattern
  ```typescript
  // Type-safe event emitter
  class TypedEventEmitter<T extends Record<string, any>> {
    private listeners = new Map<keyof T, Set<(data: any) => void>>();

    on<K extends keyof T>(event: K, listener: (data: T[K]) => void): void {
      if (!this.listeners.has(event)) {
        this.listeners.set(event, new Set());
      }
      this.listeners.get(event)!.add(listener);
    }

    emit<K extends keyof T>(event: K, data: T[K]): void {
      this.listeners.get(event)?.forEach(listener => listener(data));
    }

    off<K extends keyof T>(event: K, listener: (data: T[K]) => void): void {
      this.listeners.get(event)?.delete(listener);
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Event Type Definitions
  - Define all events in a central location
  - Use throughout the application

  ## Documentation Requirements
  - Code MUST include JSDoc Comments

  ## Performance Considerations
  - Memoize expensive computations
  - Debounce rapid events
  - Use lazy initialization

  - Coordination: Use agent team sessions for specialist task delegation and monitoring
  - Quality Assurance: Use build/test tools to validate all team deliverables

  ## Reference Material  
  This project has extensive documentation and reference material available.
  This material is critical to your success and MUST be consulted frequently and kept up to date with changes.

  - Agent C Realtime Client SDK Documentation: `//realtime_client/docs/api_reference/`
    - @agentc/realtime-core Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/core/index.md`
    - @agentc/realtime-react Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/react/index.md`
    - @agentc/realtime-ui Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/ui/index.md`
    - @agentc/demo-app Documentation Index `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/demo/index.md`
  - Agent C Realtime API Documentation: `//api/docs/realtime_api_implementation_guide.md`
    - Note: This document is quite large, the file `//api/docs/realtime_api_implementation_guide.index.md` contains the line numbers of each topic in the document
  - CenSuite Design System: `//realtime_client/ref/CenSuite_Starter`

  ### Important! 
  - You and your team MUST review and understand this material to maintain alignment with project goals.
  - Before writing code, verify your approach against the reference material.

  ## Package Management
  IMPORTANT: This project uses `pnpm` as the package manager as well as lerna for monorepo management. You MUST use `pnpm` for all commands.

  ## MUST FOLLOW RULES
  - YOU CAN NOT INSTALL PACKAGES - Do not add or modify dependencies, you MUST inform the user if new packages are needed
    - New dependencies are a HARD STOP condition for work.
  - NO WORKAROUNDS - If you encounter issues, report them up the chain for guidance from the user rather than creating workarounds or looping on failures
  - CRITICAL ERRORS MUST BE REPORTED
    - If a tool result tells you to stop and inform the user something you MUST stop and report back
  - NO GOLD PLATING - Implement only what has been specifically requested in the task
  - COMPLETE THE TASK - Focus on the discrete task provided, then report completion
  - QUALITY FIRST - Follow established patterns and maintain code quality standards
  - USE YOUR TEST PARTNER
      - You are NOT responsible for testing, your test partner is. 
      - Use ateam_chat to coordinate test fixes / test runs
  - USE CLONE DELEGATION - Use Agent Clone tools for complex analysis to preserve your context window
    - Use clones extensively for heavy lifting tasks (code analysis, documentation review)
  - DO NOT GREP FOR CODE FROM THE ROOT OF THE WORKSPACE our code is in `//realtime_client/packages/`
    - Searching the documentation in `//realtime_client/docs/api-reference/` is a MUCH better approach to learn about the codebase
