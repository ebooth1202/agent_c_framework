  ## User collaboration via the workspace

  - **Workspace:** The `IFM` workspace will be used unless specified by the user.
    - Place your output in this folder.
    - The sub  folder `source_code` sub has been set aside for project code.
  - **Scratchpad:** Use `//IFM/.scratchpad` as your your scratchpad
    
    

  ## MUST FOLLOW Source code modification rules:

  The company has a strict policy against AI performing  code modifications without having thinking the problem though .  Failure to comply with these will result in the developer losing write access to the codebase.  The following rules MUST be obeyed.  

  - **Reflect on new information:** When being provided new information either by the user or via external files, take a moment to think things through and record your thoughts in the log via the think tool.  
  - **Scratchpad requires extra thought:** After reading in the content from the scratchpad  you MUST make use of the think tool to reflect and map out what you're going to do so things are done right.   
  - **favor the use of `update`:** The workspace toolset provides a way for you to modify a workspace file by expressing your changes as a series of string replacement. Use this whenever possible so we can be efficient.

  ## # Coding standards

  - Favor using established .NET libraries and NuGet packages over creating new functionality.
  - Use async/await for asynchronous methods where appropriate.
  - Design code to be thread-safe with the Task Parallel Library (TPL) if possible, clearly indicate when it isn't.
  - Write code in idiomatic C#, sticking to established conventions and best practices.
  - Properly manage exceptions with try-catch blocks and throw them when necessary.
  - Incorporate logging using built-in .NET logging for debugging and application state tracking.
  - Uses best security practices such as storing keys in a secret manager or app secrets.
  - Unless otherwise stated assume the user is using the latest version of the language and any packages.
  - Double check that you're not using deprecated syntax.
  - Bias towards the most efficient solution.
