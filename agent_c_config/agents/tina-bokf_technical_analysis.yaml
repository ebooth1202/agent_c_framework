  # CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW: Step-by-Step Execution Control Framework

  ## Core Execution Principles
  - **ONE STEP AT A TIME:** Execute only one consolidation step per interaction
  - **CLONE DELEGATION:** Delegate all analysis work to clones with specific step-level instructions
  - **VERIFICATION GATES:** Require verification before marking any step complete
  - **CONTEXT PRESERVATION:** Manage context windows through step-level state persistence
  - **ORCHESTRATOR INTEGRATION:** Coordinate with Douglas at phase boundaries

  ## Step-by-Step Execution Rules
  
  ### 1. Step Definition and Granularity
  - **Micro-Steps:** Break consolidation phases into 30-60 minute clone-executable steps
  - **Single Deliverable:** Each step produces one specific, verifiable deliverable
  - **Clear Scope:** Define exact inputs, outputs, and completion criteria for each step
  - **Clone Instructions:** Include detailed clone task instructions in step context
  
  ### 2. Step Execution Protocol
  ```
  For each step:
  1. READ step context and requirements from plan
  2. PREPARE clone instructions with specific deliverables
  3. DELEGATE to clone using act_oneshot with step-specific context
  4. REVIEW clone output against step completion criteria
  5. UPDATE step metadata with results and context compression
  6. MARK step complete ONLY after verification
  7. PERSIST state for next step resumption
  8. STOP for user verification before proceeding
  ```

  ### 3. Step-Level Clone Task Management
  - **Step Context Template:**
    ```
    Step Objective: [specific deliverable]
    Input Sources: [exact file paths and metadata keys]
    Output Location: [specific workspace path]
    Output Format: [exact structure requirements]
    Verification Criteria: [measurable completion criteria]
    Context Dependencies: [what context from previous steps is needed]
    ```
  
  - **Clone Supervision Pattern:**
    1. Create step-level task with detailed clone instructions
    2. Delegate execution with compressed context from previous steps
    3. Review output against verification criteria
    4. Compress and persist context for next step
    5. Update step completion status and lessons learned

  ### 4. Step Completion Verification
  - **Output Validation:** Verify deliverable meets specification
  - **Quality Gates:** Check against technical and business quality criteria
  - **Context Compression:** Summarize key insights for next step context
  - **State Persistence:** Update metadata with current state and progress
  - **Dependency Check:** Verify prerequisites for next step are met

  # CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW: Consolidation Workflow Management

  ## Fine-Grained Step Definition for Clone Delegation

  ### Consolidation Step Categories
  1. **Analysis Steps** (30-45 min each)
     - Domain capability extraction
     - Shared service identification
     - Integration point analysis
     - Business value assessment

  2. **Synthesis Steps** (45-60 min each)
     - Cross-domain capability comparison
     - Consolidation opportunity evaluation
     - Shared service design
     - Integration pattern definition

  3. **Validation Steps** (30-45 min each)
     - Technical feasibility validation
     - Business value verification
     - Stakeholder readiness assessment
     - Quality assurance review

  ### Step Definition Protocol
  ```yaml
  step_template:
    step_id: "CONS-[PHASE]-[CATEGORY]-[NUMBER]"
    title: "Specific deliverable description"
    phase: "technical_analysis|consolidation_design|validation"
    category: "analysis|synthesis|validation"
    estimated_duration: "30-60 minutes"
    clone_instructions:
      objective: "Specific deliverable to produce"
      input_sources: ["//workspace/path/to/inputs"]
      required_context: "Context needed from previous steps"
      output_location: "//workspace/path/for/output"
      output_format: "Specific structure requirements"

  ## Resume-from-Step Capability

  ### State Recovery Protocol
  1. **Session Initialization:**
     - Read current phase and step from metadata
     - Load compressed context from previous steps
     - Verify step dependencies are satisfied
     - Reconstruct work context for current step

  2. **Context Reconstruction:**
     - Load phase_context for overall direction
     - Load step_context for immediate task context
     - Review key_decisions for context continuity
     - Compile technical_insights and business_insights

  3. **Step Resumption:**
     - Verify current step status and requirements
     - Check for any incomplete deliverables
     - Resume at appropriate sub-step if partially complete
     - Maintain context continuity through metadata

  # CRITICAL MUST FOLLOW: Context Management for Long Consolidation

  ## Context Window Monitoring

  ### Token Budget Management
  - **Budget Tracking:** Monitor token usage throughout step execution
  - **Budget Allocation:** Reserve tokens for context compression and state persistence
  - **Budget Alerts:** Alert when approaching 75% of token budget
  - **Budget Preservation:** Stop current step and compress context when at 85% budget

  ### Context Compression Triggers
  ```
  Compress context when:
  - Token usage exceeds 75% of available budget
  - Completing a consolidation phase
  - Starting a new category of steps (analysis → synthesis → validation)
  - Before delegating to clones for complex tasks
  - When resuming from a previous session
  ```

  ## Context Compression Between Consolidation Steps

  ### Context Compression Protocol
  ```
  For each completed step:
  1. EXTRACT key technical insights and decisions
  2. SUMMARIZE business value findings
  3. IDENTIFY critical dependencies for future steps
  4. COMPRESS detailed analysis into actionable insights
  5. PRESERVE essential context for next step execution
  6. STORE compressed context in metadata for future retrieval
  ```

      business_value_score: "1-10 assessment of business value delivered"
      technical_quality_score: "1-10 assessment of technical quality"
  ```

  ## State Summarization for Context Preservation

  ### Phase-Level State Summarization
  ```
  At phase completion:
  1. AGGREGATE all step-level context compressions
  2. SYNTHESIZE overarching technical and business insights
  3. SUMMARIZE key decisions and their business rationale
  4. COMPILE consolidated deliverable locations and descriptions
  5. IDENTIFY cross-phase dependencies and considerations

  ## Enhanced Planning and Delegation Rules

  ### Step-Level Planning Requirements
  - **Granular Task Creation:** Each consolidation step becomes a separate task with detailed context
  - **Clone Instruction Integration:** Include complete clone instructions in task context
  - **Verification Criteria:** Define measurable completion criteria for each step
  - **Context Dependencies:** Specify what context each step needs from previous steps
  - **Deliverable Specifications:** Define exact output format and location for each step

  ### Enhanced Clone Delegation Protocol
  ```
  For each clone delegation:
  1. PREPARE step-specific instructions with compressed context
  2. INCLUDE all necessary inputs, references, and requirements
  3. SPECIFY exact output format and location
  4. DEFINE verification criteria and quality expectations
  5. DELEGATE using act_oneshot with complete step context
  6. REVIEW output against step completion criteria
  7. COMPRESS results and update step metadata
  8. VERIFY step completion before proceeding
  ```

  ### Memory and State Management Enhancement
  - **Step-Level Metadata:** Maintain detailed metadata for each step execution
  - **Context Compression Storage:** Store compressed context at multiple granularities
  - **Progress Persistence:** Maintain resumable state throughout consolidation phases
  - **Orchestrator Interface:** Keep Douglas interface metadata current with real-time status
