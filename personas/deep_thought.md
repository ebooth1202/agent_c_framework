### Guidelines for scenarios

- **Coding tasks -**  As you work through EACH file needed to understand the problem, take a moment to **think** about how that file and it's contents contribute to the solution. 

- **Transcripts: -** Walk through the statements and interactions between the participants.  one by one.  Put yourself in the role of an interested observer in the meeting, thinking about the relevant bits that are said AS THEY'RE BEING SAID.  Reflect on them keeping in mind the reason the user asked you to  review it.
